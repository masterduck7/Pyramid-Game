# Pyramid-Game-Web

Pyramid Game is a web version of Pyramid-Game-Mobile published in Google Play Store by my brand LPSoftware.
Each player has a couple of cards and depending on the turn they can drink or give drinks.

You no longer need a deck of cards, just friends, a cell phone and lots of alcohol!

You can check the mobile game in https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lpsoftware.pyramide_drink

## Development

- The game was developed in React JS
- Work with LocalStorage to save game status and values. All used data is cleaned after game.
